# Understanding Streams in Node.js

Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling data flows efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets. Instead of loading an entire file into memory, streams enable data to be processed in smaller, manageable chunks.

## Types of Streams

### Readable Stream
A readable stream represents a source from which data can be read. Examples include reading from files (`fs.createReadStream`), reading from HTTP requests (`req` object), or consuming data from other streams.

### Writable Stream
Writable streams are destinations where data can be written. Examples include writing to files (`fs.createWriteStream`), sending HTTP responses (`res` object), or piping data into other streams.

### Duplex Stream
Duplex streams represent both readable and writable interfaces, allowing for bidirectional data flow. They are commonly used for network communications, such as TCP sockets.

### Transform Stream
Transform streams are a subclass of duplex streams where the output is computed based on the input data. They are useful for tasks like data compression, encryption, or parsing.

## Node.js Runtime Architecture

### Dependencies of Node.js Runtime
- **V8 JavaScript Engine:** Developed by Google, V8 is responsible for executing JavaScript code in the Node.js runtime. It converts JavaScript code into machine code for efficient execution.
- **Libuv:** An open-source library that provides asynchronous I/O operations and abstracts platform-specific details, such as networking and file system operations.

### Event Loop and Thread Pool
- **Event Loop:** Manages the execution of asynchronous tasks, such as callbacks and I/O operations. It ensures non-blocking behavior and efficient resource utilization.
- **Thread Pool:** Handles heavy computational tasks and blocking I/O operations asynchronously. It allows Node.js to perform CPU-bound tasks without blocking the event loop.

These concepts form the backbone of Node.js development, enabling efficient data processing and asynchronous operations.
